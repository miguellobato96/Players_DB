Football Player Data Management

This program was created to manage a football player database. The graphical interface was developed using the CustomTkinter library, providing an intuitive interaction.

Usage:

1. Database Creation: Allows creating the "Players.db" database and the "Players" table with information such as ID, Name, Nationality, Age, Position, and Current Club.

2. Integrated SQL Queries:
- List all players over 30 years old;
- Identify the youngest player in the database;
- Catalog players by nationality;
- Calculate the average age of players by club;
- Determine the club with the highest number of non-national players.
